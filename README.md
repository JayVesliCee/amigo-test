Technical test for Amigo


```
If you haven’t already done so, please answer the following questions:
• Which three words describe a great developer?
• What is your most indispensable development workflow tool and why?
• How do you like your coffee?
```

- Curiosity, adaptability, team-work
- Git, mainly because of the versioning, sharing etc. I also love drone, helps a lot because it tests your builds and deploy them through docker. It's now a day hard to work - specially with go - without drone / github
- The same way I like my woman, strong & dark spirit that can be slightly soother with a bit of sugar. Obviously she is lactose intolerant
